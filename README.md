# Proxy Herd with asyncio

## Description
This project implements a distributed server system using Python's `asyncio` framework to create an "application server herd." The goal is to evaluate `asyncio` as a framework for handling real-time, high-frequency data updates in a decentralized system. The project consists of multiple interconnected servers that process client location updates and respond to queries using the Google Places API.

## Features
- **Distributed Server Communication**: Servers propagate location updates using a simple flooding algorithm.
- **Asynchronous TCP Handling**: Clients communicate with servers via TCP sockets.
- **Google Places API Integration**: Servers fetch nearby place data for clients on request.
- **Fault Tolerance**: Servers continue operating even if neighbors disconnect.
- **Logging**: Each server logs its input, output, and connections.

## Installation
### Prerequisites
- Python 3.11.2
- `aiohttp` library
- `pyyaml` library

### Steps
1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/aandrewduong/asyncio-proxy-herd.git
   cd your-repo
   ```
2. Start the servers:
   ```sh
   ./start_servers.sh
   ```
3. Run the benchmark tool:
   ```sh
   python3 benchmark.py
   ```

## Configuration
The `config.yml` file contains:
- **Server Ports**: Mapping of server names to their respective ports.
- **Neighbor Relationships**: Defines how servers communicate with each other.
- **Benchmarking**: Configures test parameters such as number of clients, test duration, and timeout.
- **Logging**: Specifies log level, filename, and format.

Example `config.yml` snippet:
```yaml
benchmark:
  num_clients: 5
  test_duration: 5  # in seconds
  timeout: 2  # in seconds
logging:
  level: "INFO"
  filename: "benchmark.log"
  format: "%(asctime)s - %(levelname)s - %(message)s"
```

## Usage
### Server Commands
- **IAMAT**: Clients send location updates to the server.
  ```
  IAMAT <client_id> <latitude+longitude> <timestamp>
  ```
- **WHATSAT**: Clients request nearby places based on a client's last known location.
  ```
  WHATSAT <client_id> <radius_km> <max_results>
  ```
- **AT**: Internal message format for propagating location updates between servers.
  ```
  AT <server_id> <time_diff> <client_id> <latitude+longitude> <timestamp>
  ```
- **Invalid Command Response**: Servers return:
  ```
  ? <invalid_command>
  ```

### Example
Client sends:
```
IAMAT kiwi.cs.ucla.edu +34.068930-118.445127 1621464827.959498503
```
Server responds:
```
AT Clark +0.263873386 kiwi.cs.ucla.edu +34.068930-118.445127 1621464827.959498503
```

### WHATSAT Example
Client requests nearby places:
```
WHATSAT kiwi.cs.ucla.edu 10 5
```
Server responds with:
```
AT Clark +0.263873386 kiwi.cs.ucla.edu +34.068930-118.445127 1621464827.959498503
{
   "results": [
      { "name": "Place 1", "vicinity": "Location 1" },
      { "name": "Place 2", "vicinity": "Location 2" }
   ]
}
```

## Benchmarking
Run the benchmark tool to measure server latency:
```
python3 benchmark.py
```
Example output:
```
Total Requests Sent: 120
Average Latency: 0.0342 sec
Max Latency: 0.1023 sec
Min Latency: 0.0014 sec
```

## Research Report
The research [report](https://github.com/aandrewduong/asyncio-proxy-herd/blob/main/report.pdf), provides an in-depth analysis of `asyncio` as a framework for this architecture. It evaluates performance, maintainability, type safety, and comparisons with other asynchronous frameworks such as Node.js. The report also discusses Python's concurrency model, memory management, and suitability for large-scale distributed systems.
